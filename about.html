    <p>Hi, my name is Mason Gilbert and I am currently a student at Kennesaw State University. I am currently in my sophmore year so far. I am majoring in Informational Technology, a field I find enjoyable as I love technology.</p>
    <p>Before I started attending KSU, I attended Allatoona High School. I always strived to exceed in all of my classes, paving the way for my future. In order to further that goal, I decided to take advantage of the free Dual Enrollment Plan. This would allow for me to get ahead on my future classes at KSU, allowing for me to possibly graduate a year early and get a feel on college life.</p>
    <p>By the time I graduated in 2023, I was well ahead of my classes and get a jump start. So far, I am enjoying my time here at KSU. I am glad that I have the opportunity to learn on this campus as my journey continues to grow each day!</p>
